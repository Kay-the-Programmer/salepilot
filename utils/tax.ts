/**
 * What tax is due on a sale, line by line.
 *
 * The old model was one flat rate applied to the whole basket. That cannot be
 * right for a shop selling more than one kind of thing: mealie meal is
 * zero-rated, soap is standard-rated, and a single percentage on the subtotal
 * charges the customer the wrong amount on every mixed basket.
 *
 * Two things vary and both live here:
 *
 *  * **Tax class per product** — standard, zero-rated, or exempt. Zero and
 *    exempt both attract no tax, but they are kept apart because a VAT return
 *    reports them differently: zero-rated supplies are taxable at 0%, exempt
 *    ones are outside the tax entirely.
 *  * **Whether prices already include tax.** Shelf prices in most retail here
 *    are quoted tax-inclusive, in which case tax is *extracted* from the price
 *    rather than added to it.
 *
 * A mirror of `src/services/tax.ts` in s-back, kept deliberately identical.
 * The till shows a customer their total before the server has seen the sale;
 * the server then recomputes it as the authority. If the two ever disagree a
 * shopper is quoted one figure and charged another, so any change here must be
 * made there in the same commit.
