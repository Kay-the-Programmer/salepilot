Welcome to Lenco's API doc

# Welcome to Lenco's API doc

With Lenco API, you can access all your accounts and sub-accounts and their transaction histories. You’ll learn how to build amazing web and mobile integration payment experiences with the Lenco API.

These docs will cover the available endpoints and provide example code for using the API. They will hopefully help you build your own admin tools or automate processes that previously had to be performed manually.

If you have any questions, just send us an email at <support@lenco.co>.

Getting Started

# Getting Started

This page will help you get started with Lenco API

To get your API token (also referred to as api key or secret key), kindly reach out to <support@lenco.co>

## Securing Your API Token

Someone who steals your Lenco API token can interact with your accounts on your behalf, so treat it as securely as you would treat any password. Tokens should never be stored in source control. If you accidentally publicize a token via version control or other methods, you should immediately reach out to <support@lenco.co> to generate a new API token.

## Using the Token

Authenticate your API calls by including your api token in the Authorization header of every request you make.\
Authorization headers should be in the following format: Authorization: `Bearer API_TOKEN`

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer xo+CAiijrIy9XvZCYyhjrv0fpSAL6CfU8CgA+up1NXqK"
```

API requests made without authentication will fail with the status code `401: Unauthorized`. All API requests must be made over HTTPS.

## Requests and Response

Both request body data and response data are formatted as JSON. Content type for responses will always be `application/json`. Generally, all responses will be in the following format:

Response Format

```json
{
  "status": [boolean],  // Only true if the details provided could be processed and no error occured while processing
  "message": [string], // Explains why status is false... Entirely informational. Please only log this but do not use for your checks
  "data": [object]    // contains actionable result of processing if present
}
```

While we generally recommend that developers use HTTP status codes to determine the result of an API call, we have provided a handy status key to let you know upfront if the request was successful or not.

The message key is a string which will contain a summary of the response and its status. For instance when trying to retrieve a list of recipients, message might read “Recipients retrieved”. In the event of an error, the message key will contain a description of the error as with the authorization header situation above. This is the only key that is universal across requests.

The data key is where you want to look at for the result of your request. It can either be an object, or an array depending on the request made. For instance, a request to retrieve a single recipient will return a recipient object in the data key, while the key would be an array of recipients if a list is requested instead.

The meta key is used to provide context for the contents of the data key. For instance, when retrieving the list of transactions, pagination parameters can be passed along to limit the result set. The meta key will then contain an object with the following attributes:

Meta Key Structure

```json
"meta": {
  "total": 2,
  "perPage": 50,
  "currentPage": 1,
  "pageCount": 1
}
```

## Keys

**total** number\
This is the total number of records.

**perPage** number\
This is the maximum number of records that will be returned per request.

**currentPage** number\
This is the current `page` being returned. This is dependent on what page was requested using the `page` query parameter. **Default: 1**

**pageCount** number\
This is how many pages in total are available for retrieval considering the maximum number of records returned per request (i.e. `perPage`). For context, if there are 101 records and `perPage` is 100, `pageCount` will have a value of 2.

## Errors

Lenco's API is RESTful and as such, uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of requests.\
The common error codes can be found below:

**200, 201**\
Request was successful and intended action was carried out. Note that we will always send a 200 if a transfer or collection request was made. Do check the data object to know how the request went (i.e. successful or failed).

**400**\
A validation or client side error occurred and the request was not fulfilled.

**401**\
The request was not authorized. This can be triggered by passing an invalid API token in the authorization header or the lack of one.

**404**\
Request could not be fulfilled as the request resource does not exist.

**500, 501, 502, 503, 504**\
Request could not be fulfilled due to an error on Lenco's end. This shouldn't happen so please report as soon as you encounter any instance of this.

<br />

If the HTTP response code is not 200 (or 201), the response would optionally include `errorCode`.\
Possible values for `errorCode` is given in the table below.

| Error Code | Details                                                                    |

Accept Payments

# Accept Payments

Lenco provides a simple and convenient payment flow for web with the popup widget. It can be integrated in a few easy steps.

### Step 1: Collect customer information

To begin, you need to pass information such as email, amount, reference, etc.\
Here is the full list of parameters you can pass:

[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-0": "Param",
    "h-1": "Required?",
    "h-2": "Description",
    "0-0": "key",
    "0-1": "Yes",

    "7-0": "channels",
    "7-1": "No",
    "7-2": "An array of payment channels to control what is made available to the customer to make a payment with.  \nAvailable channels include: [`card`, `mobile-money`]",
    "8-0": "customer",
    "8-1": "No",

    "14-0": "billing.city",
    "14-1": "No",
    "14-2": "The city ",
    "15-0": "billing.state",
    "15-1": "No",
    "15-2": "The state or province.  \nIf a country does not have states or provinces, this can be left blank.  \n  \nNote: For US states and Canada provinces, this should be the 2-letter code for the state / province. i.e. California should be `CA`.  \n  \nYou can find the list of US State and Canada Province codes [here](https://www.ups.com/worldshiphelp/WSA/ENU/AppHelp/mergedProjects/CORE/Codes/State_Province_Codes.htm)",

    "19-0": "onClose",
    "19-1": "No",
    "19-2": "Javascript function that is called if the customer closes the payment window instead of making a payment.",

    "20-1": "No",
    "20-2": "Javascript function that is called if the customer closes the payment window before we verify their payment."
  },
  "cols": 3,
  "rows": 21,
  "align": [
    "left",
    "left",
    "left"
  ]
}
[/block]

<br />

### Step 2: Initiate the Payment

When you have all the details needed to initiate the payment, the next step is to pass them to Lenco to display the popup widget.

```html
<script src="https://pay.lenco.co/js/v1/inline.js"></script>

<script>
function getPaidWithLenco() {
	LencoPay.getPaid({
		key: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY', // your Lenco public key
		reference: 'ref-' + Date.now(), // a unique reference you generated
		email: 'customer@email.com', // the customer's email address
		amount: 1000, // the amount the customer is to pay
		currency: "ZMW",
		channels: ["card", "mobile-money"],
		customer: {
			firstName: "John",
			lastName: "Doe",
			phone: "0971111111",
		},
		onSuccess: function (response) {
			//this happens after the payment is completed successfully
			const reference = response.reference;
			alert('Payment complete! Reference: ' + reference);
			// Make an AJAX call to your server with the reference to verify the payment
		},
		onClose: function () {
			alert('Payment was not completed, window closed.');
		},
		onConfirmationPending: function () {
			alert('Your purchase will be completed when the payment is confirmed');
		},
	});
}
</script>

```

For the sandbox environment, use `https://pay.sandbox.lenco.co/js/v1/inline.js` as the source for the lenco widget script.

**Important Notes:**

1. The `key` field takes your Lenco **public** key.
2. The `amount` field should not be converted to the lowest currency unit. Rather you can pass in a number with decimal places i.e. 10.75
3. It is ideal to generate a unique reference from your system for every payment to avoid duplicate attempts.
4. The `onSuccess` callback function is called when payment has been completed successfully. See the next section for how to handle the callback.
5. The `onClose` callback function is called if the user closes the widget without completing payment.
6. The `onConfirmationPending` callback function is called if the customer closes the payment window before we verify their payment.

<br />

### Step 3: Handle the `onSuccess` callback method

The `onSuccess` callback function is fired when the payment is successful. This is where you include any action you want to perform when the payment is successful.

The recommended next step here is to verify the payment as detailed in step 4.

> 📘
>
> **Note**\
> To verify the payment, you have to set up a route or page on your server that you pass the reference to. Then from your server, you call the verify endpoint to confirm the statis of the payment, and the response is returned to your frontend.

There are 2 ways you can call your server from the callback function

1. Make an AJAX request to the endpoint on your server that handles the payment verification

```javascript
onSuccess: function(response){
	$.ajax({
		url: 'https://www.yoururl.com/verify_payment?reference=' + response.reference,
		method: 'get',
		success: function (response) {
			// the payment status is in response.data.status
		} 
	});
}
```

2. Redirect to the verification endpoint URL on your server.

```javascript
onSuccess: function(response) {
	window.location = "https://www.yoururl.com/verify_payment.php?reference=" + response.reference;
}
// On the redirected page, you can call Lenco's API to verify the payment.
```

> ❗️
>
> **Warning**\
> Never call the Lenco API directly from your frontend to avoid exposing your api secret key on the frontend. All requests to the Lenco API should be initiated from your server, and your frontend gets the response from your server.

<br />

### Step 4: Verify the Payment

You do this by making a GET request to `https://api.lenco.co/access/v2/collections/status/:reference` from your server using your reference. You can find more information about this endpoint [here](https://lenco-api.readme.io/v2.0/reference/get-collection-by-reference).

```curl
# Sample Request

curl https://api.lenco.co/access/v2/collections/status/ref-1
-H "Authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY"
-X GET
```
```json
// Sample Response

{
  "status": true,
  "message": "",
  "data": {
    "id": "d7bd9ccb-0737-4e72-a387-d00454341f21",
    "initiatedAt": "2024-03-12T07:06:11.562Z",
    "completedAt": "2024-03-12T07:14:10.412Z",
    "amount": "10.00",
    "fee": "0.25",
    "bearer": "merchant",
    "currency": "ZMW",
    "reference": "ref-1",
    "lencoReference": "240720004",
    "type": "mobile-money",
    "status": "successful",
    "source": "api",
    "reasonForFailure": null,
    "settlementStatus": "settled",
    "settlement": {
      "id": "c04583d7-d026-4dfa-b8b5-e96f17f93bb8",
      "amountSettled": "9.75",
      "currency": "ZMW",
      "createdAt": "2024-03-12T07:14:10.439Z",
      "settledAt": "2024-03-12T07:14:10.496Z",
      "status": "settled",
      "type": "instant",
      "accountId": "68f11209-451f-4a15-bfcd-d916eb8b09f4"
    },
    "mobileMoneyDetails": {
      "country": "zm",
      "phone": "0977433571",
      "operator": "airtel",
      "accountName": "Beata Jean",
      "operatorTransactionId": "MP240312.0000.A00001"
    },
    "bankAccountDetails": null,
    "cardDetails": null
  }
}
```

<br />

### Step 5: Handle webhook

When a payment is successful, Lenco sends a `collection.successful` webhook event to your webhook URL. You can [learn more here](https://lenco-api.readme.io/v2.0/reference/webhooks).

/collections/mobile-money

# /collections/mobile-money

This endpoint allows you to request a payment from customers by using their phone number enabled for mobile money.

At the point of payment, the customer is required to authorize the payment on their mobile phones. The status of the collection request would be `pay-offline`.\
Once you get this status, you should notify the customer to complete the authorization process on their mobile phones and then listen for webhook notification or requery the [collection request status endpoint](https://lenco-api.readme.io/v2.0/reference/get-collection-by-reference) at interval.

/collections/card

# /collections/card

> 📘 PCI DSS required
>
> Using this endpoint involves dealing with cardholder Personally Identifying Information (PII). A Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) certificate is therefore required.

This endpoint allows you to request a payment from customers by charging their debit/credit cards.

You send the customer details along with the card and billing information.

**Request**

The request payload would be encrypted. Please follow the guide [here](https://lenco-api.readme.io/v2.0/reference/encryption).\
The parameters you can use to build the request payload are given below:

**Response**

For cards that require 3D Secure authorization, the value of `data`.`status` would be "3ds-auth-required" and the response would include an `authorization` object in the `meta` key.\
This `authorization` object would contain a `mode` key which will be "redirect", and a `redirect` key.\
You should redirect your customer to the URL specified in `meta`.`authorization`.`redirect` to complete the 3DS authorization.

Webhooks

# Webhooks

Learn how to listen to events whenever certain actions occur on your integration.

## What are webhooks?

Whenever certain actions occur on your Lenco account or API integration, we trigger events which your application can listen to. This is where webhooks come in. A webhook is a URL on your server where we send payloads for such events. For example, if you implement webhooks, once a transfer is successful, we will immediately notify your server with a `transfer.successful` event. Here is a [list of events](#types-of-events) we can send to your webhook URL.

> 📘
>
> **NB**: You may not be able to rely completely on webhooks to get notified. An example is if your server is experiencing a downtime and your hook endpoints are affected, some customers might still be transacting independently of that and the hook call triggered would fail because your server was unreachable.
>
> *In such cases we advise that developers set up a re-query service that goes to poll for the transaction status at regular intervals e.g. every 30 minutes using the `/transfers/:id` or `/transfers/status/:reference` endpoint, till a successful or failed response is returned.*

To setup your webhook URL, kindly reach out to <support@lenco.co>

**Here are some things to note when setting up a webhook URL:**

1. If using .htaccess, remember to add the trailing / to the url you set.
2. Do a test post to your URL and ensure the script gets the post body.
3. Ensure your webhook URL is publicly available (localhost URLs cannot receive events)

## Receiving an event

All you have to do to receive the event is to create an unauthenticated POST route on your application. The event object is sent as JSON in the request body.

```javascript Node
// Using Express
app.post("/my/webhook/url", function(req, res) {
    // Retrieve the request's body
    var event = req.body;
    // Do something with event
    res.send(200);
});
```
```php
<?php
// Retrieve the request's body and parse it as JSON
$input = @file_get_contents("php://input");
$event = json_decode($input);
// Do something with $event
http_response_code(200); // PHP 5.4 or greater
?>
```

## Verifying events

It is important to verify that events originate from Lenco to avoid delivering value based on a counterfeit event.\
Valid events are raised with an header `X-Lenco-Signature` which is essentially a HMAC SHA512 signature of the event payload signed using your `webhook_hash_key`.\
The `webhook_hash_key` is a SHA256 hash of your API token.

```javascript Node
var crypto = require('crypto');
var apiToken = process.env.API_TOKEN;
var webhookHashKey = crypto.createHash("sha256").update(apiToken).digest("hex");
// Using Express
app.post("/my/webhook/url", function(req, res) {
    //validate event
    var hash = crypto.createHmac('sha512', webhookHashKey).update(JSON.stringify(req.body)).digest('hex');
    if (hash === req.headers['x-lenco-signature']) {
        // Retrieve the request's body
        var event = req.body;
        // Do something with event  
    }
    res.send(200);
});
```
```php
<?php
// only a post with lenco signature header gets our attention
if ((strtoupper($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']) != 'POST' ) || !array_key_exists('HTTP_X_LENCO_SIGNATURE', $_SERVER) ) 
    exit();
// Retrieve the request's body
$input = @file_get_contents("php://input");
define('LENCO_API_TOKEN','API_TOKEN');
$webhook_hash_key = hash("sha256", LENCO_API_TOKEN);
// validate event do all at once to avoid timing attack
if($_SERVER['HTTP_X_LENCO_SIGNATURE'] !== hash_hmac('sha512', $input, $webhook_hash_key))
    exit();
http_response_code(200);
// parse event (which is json string) as object
// Do something - that will not take long - with $event
$event = json_decode($input);
exit();
?>
```

## Responding to an event

You should respond to an event with a `200` OK. We consider this an acknowledgement by your application. If your application responds with any status outside of either `200`, `201`, or `202`, we will consider it unacknowledged and thus, continue to send it every 30 minutes for 24 hours. You don't need to send a request body or some other parameter as it would be discarded - we only pay attention to the status code.

If your application is likely to start a long running task in response to the event, Lenco may timeout waiting for the response and would ultimately consider the event unacknowledged and queue to be raised later. You can mitigate duplicity by having your application respond immediately with a 200 before it goes on to perform the rest of the task.

## Types of events

Here are the events we currently raise. We would add more to this list as we hook into more actions in the future.

| Event                   | Description                                                                             |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `transfer.successful`   | A transfer was successfully completed from any of the accounts linked to your API token |
| `transfer.failed`       | A transfer you attempted from any of the accounts linked to your API token has failed   |
| `collection.successful` | A collection you attempted was successfully completed                                   |
| `collection.failed`     | A collection you attempted has failed                                                   |
| `collection.settled`    | Your account was credited for a collection                                              |
| `transaction.credit`    | An account linked to your API token was credited                                        |
| `transaction.debit`     | An account linked to your API token was debited                                         |

Encryption

# Encryption

The transport between client applications and Lenco is secured using TLS/SSL, which means data is encrypted by default when transmitted across networks.

In addition, certain endpoints of the Lenco API make use of JSON Web Encryption (JWE) to provide end-to-end payload encryption to secure sensitive data. For instance, the [Card Collection API](https://lenco-api.readme.io/v2.0/reference/initiate-collection-from-card) must comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard in dealing with cardholder Personally Identifying Information (PII).

JSON Web Encryption (JWE) represents encrypted content using JSON-based data structures and base64url encoding. Lenco uses JWE compact serialization for the encryption of sensitive data.

Lenco encryption uses AES in GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) mode with PKCS#7 padding and RSA with OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding).

<br />

### The Encryption Keys

**RSA**\
Encryption involves a 2048-bit RSA public/private key pair. Data encrypted using a public key can only be decrypted using the corresponding private key.

The client application will get an RSA public key using the [Get Encryption Key](https://lenco-api.readme.io/v2.0/reference/get-encryption-key) endpoint, which allows to encrypt the request payload.

**AES**\
For performance reasons, RSA asymmetric encryption is combined with AES symmetric encryption. For that, a one-time usage 256-bit AES session key is generated and encrypted using the RSA public key. The encrypted (or wrapped) key is sent in the payload along with the encrypted data.

<br />

### The Encryption Process

Here are the steps for sending an encrypted payload:

1. An AES session key is generated along with some encryption parameters
2. Sensitive data are encrypted using the AES key
3. The AES key is encrypted using the RSA public key gotten from the [Get Encryption Key](https://lenco-api.readme.io/v2.0/reference/get-encryption-key) endpoint
4. The payload is sent with the encrypted session key and parameters

<br />

### How to Encrypt Payload

The encrypted payload is structured in JSON Web Encryption (JWE) format, the plain text JSON body is encrypted to form a JWE encrypted payload that is sent as the request body (replacing the plain text data).

**Step 1**: Construct the original JSON per the API specification.

**Step 2**: Get the RSA public key using from the [Get Encryption Key](https://lenco-api.readme.io/v2.0/reference/get-encryption-key) endpoint. Beware that this key might change anytime and therefore should not be stored and reused.

**Step 3**: Use JWE to encrypt the original request in compact serialized form using the below JOSE headers:

| JOSE Header | Value                                      | Description                                                                                   |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| enc         | A256GCM                                    | encryption algorithm                                                                          |
| alg         | RSA-OAEP-256                               | Key encryption algorithm                                                                      |
| cty         | application/json                           | content type of the encrypted payload                                                         |
| kid         | `kid` property of the RSA public key (JWK) | Public Fingerprint ID which is used to identify the private key needed to decrypt the message |

**Step 4**: Construct request payload as shown below:

```json
{
	"encryptedPayload": "JWE encrypted payload"
}
```

<br />

Examples:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/jwa"
	"github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/jwe"
	"github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/jwk"
)

func encrypt(payload []byte) (string, error) {
	jwkJSON := `{
		"kty": "RSA",
		"use": "enc",
		"n": "nApb8LyyFrZw4A(...)W1RpGR6Z7zcNikiZcQ",
		"e": "AQAB",
		"kid": "2bbb0d(...)2f68aa"
	}`

	rsaPublicKey, err := jwk.ParseKey([]byte(jwkJSON))
	if err != nil {
		return "", err
	}

	encrypted, err := jwe.Encrypt(payload, jwa.RSA_OAEP_256, rsaPublicKey, jwa.A256GCM, jwa.NoCompress)
	if err != nil {
		return "", err
	}

	return string(encrypted[:]), nil
}
```
```node
const jose = require("jose");

async function encrypt(payload) {
    const jwkData = {
        "kty": "RSA",
        "use": "enc",
        "n": "nApb8LyyFrZw4A(...)W1RpGR6Z7zcNikiZcQ",
        "e": "AQAB",
        "kid": "2bbb0d(...)2f68aa"
    };

    const rsaPublicKey = await jose.importJWK(jwkData);
    const text = JSON.stringify(payload);
    const jwe = await new jose.CompactEncrypt(new TextEncoder().encode(text))
        .setProtectedHeader({
            alg: 'RSA-OAEP-256',
            enc: 'A256GCM',
            cty: 'application/json',
            kid: jwkData.kid
        })
        .encrypt(rsaPublicKey);

    return jwe;
}
```
